        <p>Scientific explanation is routinely understood to be governed by the principle of methodological naturalism, which excludes putative supernatural causes. This conception of naturalism is dependent on a distinction between natural and supernatural which in modern discussions is regarded as largely unproblematic. However, the natural-supernatural distinction has an important history that shows how interdependent these notions once were. In the past, ideas about the relative self-sufficiency of the natural realm typically relied upon deeper theological or metaphysical assumptions that could not themselves be established by naturalistic methods. In the Middle Ages, when the natural-supernatural distinction first emerged, divine action was an integral component of natural causation. Subsequently, during the scientific revolution, the introduction of the modern conception of laws of nature, understood as divine dictates, collapsed the natural-supernatural distinction, effectively erasing the notion of natural causes. This early modern effacing of any real distinction between natural and supernatural causation paradoxically laid the foundations for a modern science that would later be understood in purely naturalistic terms. Viewed historically, scientific naturalism is indebted to particular notions of divine action.</p>

  PETER HARRISON is Research Professor and Director of the Centre for the History of European
  Discourses at the University of Queensland, Australia.  Previously he was the Andreas
  Idreos Professor of Science and Religion at the University of Oxford, where he was also
  Director of the Ian Ramsey Centre. He has published extensively in the area of intellectual
  history with a focus on the philosophical, scientific and religious thought of the early
  modern period, and on the historical relations between science and religion.  His five
  books include, most recently, <cite>Wrestling with Nature: From Omens to Science</cite> (Chicago, 2011)—an
  edited collection that surveys conceptions of science from antiquity to the present—and
  <cite>The Cambridge Companion to Science and Religion</cite> (Cambridge, 2010).  He has published
  over 70 articles and book chapters. His 2011 Gifford Lectures have been published
  by the University of Chicago Press under the title <cite>The Territories of Science and Religion</cite>.
  His current research focuses on conceptions of progress in history and the historical sciences.
